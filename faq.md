# FAQ

## What is the goal of UHS?

To bring together those that like to talk about complex computer things.

For example, if you talk about SQL or TDD, we know what you mean :angel:

## Which definition of 'hacking' is used?

The most applicable version would be simply 'a computer enthusiast'.

Of course, security is an interesting topic and 
a (legal) hacking workshop is a possible activity.

UHS forbids its members to do illegal online activities (such as black hat hacking).

UHS is a place to discuss such activities (e.g. if activity X is legal yes/no).

## What are the activities by UHS?

To meet at someone's place, bringing the optional laptops and alcohol,
then chat and optionally do computer things.

## Who is UHS?

Currently, just me, [https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/).
Luckily, I am a founder of the Groninger Hackerspace called [grunndev](https://grunndev.nl/).

This website is intended to bring together hackers from Uppsala. Contact me!

## What is the difference between the Uppsala Hackerspace and the Uppsala Makerspace?

The Uppsala Makerspace has a physical space with machines that are too heavy to
carry around.

UHS has no physical space and all we need (such as laptop, Arduino), we can
carry around.

## What is the difference between the Uppsala Hackerspace and the Uppsala Linux User Group?

The Uppsala Linux User Group asssumes its members use Linux.
UHS has no such assumptions. 

## Do you use Discord?

Yes, we did.

## But Discord is proprietary and is thus evil!

You are encouraged to volunteer to maintain an IRC or Matrix
channel to follows your moral principles.

## Do you use IRC or Matrix?

No.

If you think this is important, 
you are encouraged to volunteer to set up and maintain an IRC or Matrix channel.

## Why use GitHub?

Because I maintain the website and I know GitHub.

## But GitHub is owned by Micro$oft and is thus evil!

You are encouraged to volunteer to maintain the UHS website 
in a way that aligns with your moral principles.

## What about the logo?

The logo is adapted from [the Uppsala Kommun logo](https://bonapostulata.se/sponsor/uppsala-kommun/uppsala_kommun_logo_black_rgb/),
in which a lion head (with emoticon `>:3`) 
is put in a symbol that is a mix between `U`, `[`, `]` and `)`.

Then simply the text `[>:3]` is put in green with a monospace
font on a black background.
This results in the logo-without-text:

The logo-with-text has `Uppsala Hackerspace` added as well.
